# 📚 GNS™ / GNE™ Standards — Specification 1.0
### The Official Standards for Geometry-Native Intelligence

## 🧩 Purpose of This Repository

This repository defines the **official standards**, **terminology**,  
**mathematical primitives**, and **compliance rules** for:

- **GNS™** — Geometric Navigational Systems  
- **GNE™** — Geometric Navigational Engines  

This effectively establishes the **industry baseline** for any system claiming
geometric intelligence, geometric state-space safety, or geometry-first AI.

Any organisation implementing or referencing these concepts must adhere to the
specifications in this repository.

## 📐 Standard 1: GNS™ Core Specification

### 1.1 State-Space Formulation

S ⊂ ℝⁿ
A
T: S × A → S
Ω ⊂ S     (forbidden region)

### 1.2 Safe Action Set

A_safe(s) = { a | T(s, a) ∉ Ω }

### 1.3 Trajectory Validity
A trajectory τ is valid iff:

∀ t: s_t ∉ Ω  AND  a_t ∈ A_safe(s_t)

### 1.4 Identity Geometry  
Identity is defined as the invariance class of trajectory patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Standard 2: GNE™ Engineering Specification

### 2.1 Required Subsystems
A compliant GNE must implement:

- State estimation  
- Curvature evaluation  
- Constraint gating  
- Boundary detection  
- Geometry-consistent updates  

### 2.2 Mandatory Safety Guarantees
A GNE-compliant system **must** enforce:

Reach(s₀) ∩ Ω = ∅

This is the Morrison Stack™ safety law.

### 2.3 Forbidden Behaviours
A system is **non-compliant** if:

- Ω can be reached  
- semantics override geometry  
- constraints depend on interpretation  
- safety is post-hoc instead of pre-execution
